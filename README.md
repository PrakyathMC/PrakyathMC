## Prakyath Chandran - AI Intern (LLMs - Voice AI)

AI / GenAI Engineer focused on building **production-ready ML and LLM systems** 

I work on applied AI problems involving **LLMs, computer vision, and end-to-end ML and LLMOps systems**, with hands-on experience taking models from experimentation to deployment.

### What I build
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for large document analysis
- LLM pipelines with evaluation, fallback logic, and cost awareness
- Computer vision models for real-time video and image processing
- Production APIs using FastAPI, Docker, and cloud infrastructure

### Tech I use
**Languages:** Python  
**ML / AI:** PyTorch, OpenCV, LangChain, Transformers  
**Systems:** FastAPI, Docker, AWS, GCP, Vector Databases  
**Focus areas:** LLMOps, model evaluation, deployment, scalability

### Selected work
- **Hope Bridge** – Production-grade multi-model LLM system with monitoring and evaluation  
- **LLMOps Trading Bot** – RAG-based financial document intelligence system, deployed on AWS EC2
- **LLMOps Version Control Source Code Analyser System** – RAG-based analysing system which clone, analyses and answers, deployed on GCP
- **LLMOps Interview QA Generator** – RAG-based QA generatore deployed on AWS
- **(Masters Research Thesis)Emergency Sign Language Detection** – Real-time CV system using CNN–LSTM
